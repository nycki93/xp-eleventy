# My first Eleventy site

instructions:

install nodejs and npm for your operating system

clone or copy this repo

at your command line:

- `npm install`
- `npm run serve`

this runs the dev server, which will refresh automatically as you change things. type Ctrl-C to close it.

edit the files in a code editor, I recommend VS Code.

when you're ready to update your site, type this:

- `npm run build`

this will compile your site into the _site folder, which you can upload to a static site host like neocities.
